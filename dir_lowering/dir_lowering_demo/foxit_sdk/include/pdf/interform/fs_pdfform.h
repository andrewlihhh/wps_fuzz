 * An interactive form -- sometimes referred to as an AcroForm -- is a collection of fields for gathering information

 * these fields can be imported or exported from the document.<br>
 * Function @link pdf::PDFDoc::HasForm @endlink can be used to judge if a PDF document has interactive form.<br>
 * A form object can be constructed form a specified PDF document. This class offers functions to retrieve form fields
 * or form controls, import/export form data and other features. For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>To retrieve form fields, please use functions @link Form::GetFieldCount @endlink and @link Form::GetField @endlink.</li>
 * <li>To retrieve form controls from a PDF page, please use functions @link Form::GetControlCount @endlink and

 * <li>To import form data from an XML file, please use function @link Form::ImportFromXML @endlink;
 *     to export form data to an XML file, please use function @link Form::ExportToXML @endlink.</li>
 * <li>To retrieve form filler object, please use function @link Form::GetFormFiller @endlink.</li>
 * </ul>
 * To import form data from a FDF/XFDF file or export such data to a FDF/XFDF file, please refer to functions
 * @link pdf::PDFDoc::ImportFromFDF @endlink and @link pdf::PDFDoc::ExportToFDF @endlink.<br>
 * To fill the form, please construct a form filler object by current form object or retrieve the filler object by function
