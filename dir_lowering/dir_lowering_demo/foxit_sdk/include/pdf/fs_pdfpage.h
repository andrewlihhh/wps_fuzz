 * This class is used as a manager for graphics objects. It stores all its graphics objects in a graphics list,

 * insert new graphics object and even remove one.<br>
 * If any graphics object is changed, or graphics object is inserted/removed, function
 * @link GraphicsObjects::GenerateContent @endlink should be called to ensure that all these changes would be stored
 * to PDF document. Please refer to function @link GraphicsObjects::GenerateContent @endlink for more details.<br>
 * A PDF page's content usually consists of a sequence of graphics objects, that means PDF page is used like a manager
 * for graphics objects as well. So class @link pdf::PDFPage @endlink is derived from class @link GraphicsObjects @endlink in order that
 * class @link PDFPage @endlink can retrieve its graphics object.<br>
 * A form XObject, a kind of graphics object, is a self-contained description of any  sequence of graphics objects,
 * so function @link graphics::FormXObject::GetGraphicsObjects @endlink can be used to retrieve a GraphicsObjects object
 * from a form XObject in order to manage graphics objects which are contained in a form XObject.

 * </li>
 * <li>To insert a PDF graphics object, use function @link GraphicsObjects::InsertGraphicsObject @endlink

 * <li>To remove a PDF graphics object, use functions @link GraphicsObjects::RemoveGraphicsObjectByPosition @endlink

   *              will be flattened to be a part of page contents.</li>
   *          </ul>
   *          Form field's appearance is represents by widget annotation which is a kind of annotation and
   *          treated as form control in Foxit PDF SDK. So annotation flag affects a form field as well

   *          in <PDF Reference 1.7>.<br>
   *          After an annotation or a form field is flattened, it will not be an annotation or a form field any more.
