 * In PDF 2.0, a new concept named "Associated files" is defined. Associated files provide a means to
 * associate content in other formats with objects of a PDF file and identify the relationship between
 * the content and the objects. Such associated files are designated using file specification
 * dictionaries (known as file specification). Associated files could be linked to the PDF document's catalog,
 * a page dictionary, graphics objects, structure elements, XObject, DParts, an annotation dictionary and so on.
 * Specially, associated files with graphics objects means to be associated with the marked content item.<br>
 * Class @link AssociatedFiles @endlink is the class for managing associate files. It offers the functions to
 * count/get associate files in PDF dictionary or graphics object, to associate files (represented by @link FileSpec @endlink)
 * with catalog, PDF pages, graphics objects, form XObject objects, annotation objects and so on.<br>
 * Specially, when construct an associated files object with a PDF document,
 * the file version of the related PDF document will be set to 2.0.
