/**
 * A digital signature (PDF 1.3) can be used to authenticate the identity of a user and the document's contents.
 * It stores information about the signer and the state of the document when it was signed. The signature is
 * contained in a signature field, as a type of form field, so class @link Signature @endlink is derived from
 * class @link interform::Field @endlink.
 * A signature object can be retrieved/added by following functions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>To be counted and retrieved as a signature object directly from PDF document, please use functions
 *     @link pdf::PDFDoc::GetSignatureCount @endlink and @link PDFDoc::GetSignature @endlink. </li>
 * <li>To be counted and retrieved as a signature field, please use functions
 *     @link interform::Form::GetFieldCount @endlink and @link interform::Form::GetField @endlink when field type is
 *     @link interform::Field::e_TypeSignature @endlink.</li>
 * <li>To add a new signature, please use function @link PDFPage::AddSignature @endlink.</li>
 * <li>To remove a signature, please use function @link PDFDoc::RemoveSignature @endlink.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In a signature, filter and sub filter keys are used to specify the filter and sub filter of
 * signature callback object which will be used to sign and verify the signature. Foxit PDF SDK has default
 * signature callbacks for following filter and sub filter:
 * <ul>
 * <li>filter: "Adobe.PPKLite" and sub filter: "adbe.pkcs7.detached"</li>
 * <li>filter: "Adobe.PPKLite" and sub filter: "adbe.pkcs7.sha1"</li>
 * <li>filter: "Adobe.PPKLite" and sub filter: "ETSI.CAdES.detached"</li>
 * <li>filter: "Adobe.PPKLite" and sub filter: "ETSI.RFC3161"</li>
 * </ul>
 * For sub filter "ETSI.CAdES.detached" and sub filter "ETSI.RFC3161", please ensure a default time stmap server has been
 * set to @link TimeStampServerMgr @endlink if default signature callbacks for them will be used to do signing.
 * For other filter and sub filter or if user wants to use customized signature callback for above filter and sub filter,
 * user should prepare customized signature callback and register the callback to Foxit PDF SDK by function
 * @link common::Library::RegisterSignatureCallback @endlink.<br>
 * This class offers functions to get/set signature information/properties, sign or verify a signature, and so on.
 * For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>To sign an unsigned signature, please use functions @link Signature::StartSign @endlink.
 *     When signing a signature successfully, user is strongly recommended to close current document and
 *     then open the signed PDF document and then do following operation.</li>
 * <li>To verify the integrity of a signed signature, please use functions @link Signature::StartVerify @endlink.
 *     To check if a signed signature is valid or not, please refer to class @link LTVVerifier @endlink. </li>
 * <li>To retrieve signature dictionary directly, please use function @link Signature::GetSignatureDict @endlink.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Before signing an unsigned signature, user can call following functions to set information for signing and
 * signed appearance:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>For using default Foxit appearance template, related information can be set by
 *     @link Signature::SetAppearanceFlags @endlink, @link Signature::SetSignTime @endlink, @link Signature::SetKeyValue @endlink,
 *     @link Signature::SetBitmap @endlink, @link Signature::SetImage @endlink.</li>
 * <li>For using customized appearance, please set appearance stream content by function
 *     @link Signature::SetAppearanceContent @endlink.</li>
 * </ul>
 * If an unsigned signature has been set some information for signing, but the document is saved directly or
 * closed without signing the signature, these data (including filter and sub filter) will be lost
 * in the saved document or in the closed document. When the document is opened again, the unsigned signature needs
 * to be specified at least filter and sub filter for signing; otherwise, this signature cannot be signed.
